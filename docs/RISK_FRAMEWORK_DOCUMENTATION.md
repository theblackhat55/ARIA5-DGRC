# Enhanced Risk Management Framework Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive, industry-standards-compliant risk management framework implemented in the Risk Management Platform. The framework integrates assets, services, and risks with dynamic risk calculation based on NIST 800-37 RMF, ISO 27001:2022, and other leading standards.

## Framework Architecture

### 1. Asset Management (ISO 27001:2022 Compliant)

#### Asset Classification
- **Information Assets**: Data, databases, documentation, intellectual property
- **Software Assets**: Applications, systems software, development tools  
- **Physical Assets**: Hardware, equipment, facilities, media
- **Personnel Assets**: People, qualifications, skills, experience
- **Service Assets**: Computing services, communication services
- **Intangible Assets**: Reputation, image, intellectual property rights

#### CIA Triad Assessment (NIST 800-60)
- **Confidentiality Impact**: Low, Moderate, High
- **Integrity Impact**: Low, Moderate, High  
- **Availability Impact**: Low, Moderate, High

#### Business Criticality Levels
- **Mission Critical**: RTO 1h, RPO 0.25h
- **Business Critical**: RTO 4h, RPO 1h
- **Important**: RTO 24h, RPO 4h
- **Non-Critical**: RTO 72h, RPO 24h

#### Asset Risk Score Calculation
```javascript
// NIST 800-30 approach: Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact
const maxCIA = Math.max(confidentiality, integrity, availability);
const avgCIA = (confidentiality + integrity + availability) / 3;
const impactScore = (maxCIA * 0.6) + (avgCIA * 0.4);
const riskScore = impactScore * criticality;
```

### 2. Service Management with Dependency Mapping

#### Service Tiers
- **Presentation Tier**: User interfaces, web applications, mobile apps
- **Application Tier**: Business logic, application services, APIs
- **Data Tier**: Databases, data warehouses, storage systems
- **Infrastructure Tier**: Network, compute, storage infrastructure
- **Security Tier**: Security controls, identity management, monitoring

#### Service Types with SLA Requirements
- **Business Critical**: 99.9% SLA, 8.77 hours max downtime/year
- **Business Important**: 99.5% SLA, 43.83 hours max downtime/year
- **Business Support**: 99.0% SLA, 87.66 hours max downtime/year
- **Development**: 95.0% SLA, 438.3 hours max downtime/year

#### Service Risk Score Calculation
```javascript
// Dynamic calculation based on dependent assets
const baseRisk = totalAssetRisk / assetCount;
const serviceTypeMultiplier = getServiceTypeMultiplier(serviceType);
const dependencyMultiplier = getDependencyMultiplier(dependencyCount);
const serviceRisk = baseRisk * serviceTypeMultiplier * dependencyMultiplier;
```

### 3. Integrated Risk Assessment (NIST 800-37 RMF)

#### Risk Categories (ISO 27001:2022 Annex A)
- **A.5**: Information Security Policies
- **A.6**: Organization of Information Security
- **A.7**: Human Resource Security
- **A.8**: Asset Management
- **A.9**: Access Control
- **A.10**: Cryptography
- **A.11**: Physical and Environmental Security
- **A.12**: Operations Security
- **A.13**: Communications Security
- **A.14**: System Acquisition, Development and Maintenance
- **A.15**: Supplier Relationships
- **A.16**: Information Security Incident Management
- **A.17**: Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity
- **A.18**: Compliance

#### Threat Sources (NIST 800-30)
- **Adversarial**: Hackers, nation-states, terrorists, insider threats
- **Accidental**: User errors, coding errors, faulty procedures
- **Structural**: Hardware failures, software bugs, natural disasters
- **Environmental**: Floods, earthquakes, power failures, HVAC failures

#### NIST 800-30 Risk Matrix
**Likelihood Levels:**
- Very High (>90%): Almost certain to occur
- High (70-90%): Very likely to occur
- Moderate (20-70%): Somewhat likely to occur
- Low (5-20%): Unlikely to occur
- Very Low (<5%): Highly unlikely to occur

**Impact Levels:**
- Very High: Catastrophic impact to mission
- High: Severe impact to mission
- Moderate: Serious impact to mission
- Low: Limited impact to mission
- Very Low: Negligible impact to mission

#### Enhanced Risk Calculation Formula
```javascript
// Integrated risk calculation
const baseRisk = likelihood * impact;
const assetRiskMultiplier = 1 + (avgAssetRisk / 10);
const serviceRiskMultiplier = 1 + (avgServiceRisk / 10);
const threatMultiplier = getThreatSourceMultiplier(threatSource);
const controlReduction = calculateControlEffectiveness(risk) / 10;
const integratedRisk = baseRisk * assetRiskMultiplier * serviceRiskMultiplier * threatMultiplier - controlReduction;
```

### 4. Risk Treatment Strategies (ISO 27001:2022)

- **Mitigate (Reduce)**: Implement controls to reduce likelihood or impact
- **Transfer (Share)**: Use insurance, contracts, or outsourcing
- **Accept (Retain)**: Accept the risk based on business judgment
- **Avoid (Eliminate)**: Remove the risk source or change approach

### 5. Compliance Framework Mapping

#### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Identify (ID)**: Asset Management, Governance, Risk Assessment
- **Protect (PR)**: Access Control, Awareness, Data Security
- **Detect (DE)**: Anomalies, Security Monitoring
- **Respond (RS)**: Response Planning, Communications, Analysis
- **Recover (RC)**: Recovery Planning, Improvements, Communications

#### SOC 2 Trust Service Criteria
- **Common Criteria (CC)**: Control Environment, Logical Access
- **Security**: System Protection, Network Security
- **Availability**: System Availability, Processing Integrity
- **Confidentiality**: Data Confidentiality
- **Privacy**: Personal Information Protection

### 6. Dynamic Risk Propagation

#### Asset → Service → Risk Flow
1. **Assets** have inherent risk based on CIA ratings and criticality
2. **Services** inherit risk from their dependent assets with multipliers
3. **Risks** are amplified based on affected assets and services
4. **Controls** reduce overall risk through effectiveness calculations

- Service dependency modifications
- Asset-service relationship updates
- Control implementation status changes
