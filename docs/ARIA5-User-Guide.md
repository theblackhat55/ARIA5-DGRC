## AI/ML Rating Systems

### Risk Scoring Algorithm

ARIA5.1 employs a sophisticated multi-factor risk scoring system that combines traditional risk assessment with AI-enhanced analysis.

#### Base Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score = (Probability × Impact × Context Multiplier) + AI Enhancement
```

**Components:**
- **Probability (1-10)**: Likelihood of risk occurrence
- **Impact (1-10)**: Potential business impact
- **Context Multiplier (0.5-2.0)**: Environmental and threat landscape adjustments
- **AI Enhancement (-20 to +20)**: ML-driven contextual adjustments

#### Risk Severity Classifications

| Score Range | Severity | Color Code | Action Required |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 90-100 | Critical | 🔴 Red | Immediate (0-24h) |
| 70-89 | High | 🟠 Orange | Urgent (1-7 days) |
| 40-69 | Medium | 🟡 Yellow | Scheduled (1-30 days) |
| 1-39 | Low | 🟢 Green | Routine monitoring |

#### AI Enhancement Factors

The AI enhancement component analyzes multiple data sources:

1. **Threat Intelligence Context** (+/-15 points)
   - Recent IOC correlations
   - Campaign attribution confidence
   - Attack vector prevalence

2. **Historical Pattern Analysis** (+/-10 points)
   - Similar risk outcomes
   - Mitigation effectiveness
   - Trend analysis

3. **Business Context** (+/-5 points)
   - Asset criticality
   - Operational dependencies
   - Compliance requirements

### Threat Intelligence Scoring

#### IOC Confidence Ratings

ARIA5.1 uses a multi-source confidence scoring system for Indicators of Compromise:

```
Confidence Score = Weighted Average(Source Reliability, Validation Score, Context Score)
```

**Source Reliability Weights:**
- Government/Military Sources: 1.0
- Commercial Threat Intel: 0.8
- Open Source Intelligence: 0.6
- Community Sources: 0.4
- Automated Sources: 0.2

**Validation Scoring:**
- Multiple Independent Sources: +20 points
- Single High-Quality Source: +15 points
- Correlated with Known Campaigns: +10 points
- Recent Activity (< 30 days): +5 points
- Historical Pattern Match: +3 points

**Context Scoring:**
- Direct Asset Match: +25 points
- Industry Sector Match: +15 points
- Geographic Relevance: +10 points
- Technology Stack Match: +8 points

#### Campaign Attribution Confidence

```
Attribution Confidence = (TTPs Match × 0.4) + (Infrastructure Overlap × 0.3) + 
                        (Timeline Correlation × 0.2) + (Victimology Match × 0.1)
```

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High (80-100%)**: Strong evidence across multiple indicators
- **Medium (60-79%)**: Moderate evidence with some gaps
- **Low (40-59%)**: Limited evidence, speculative
- **Unknown (<40%)**: Insufficient data for attribution

### Compliance Scoring Algorithm

#### Control Implementation Rating

ARIA5.1 evaluates compliance controls using a weighted effectiveness model:

```
Control Score = (Implementation Status × 0.4) + (Evidence Quality × 0.3) + 
                (Testing Results × 0.2) + (Maturity Level × 0.1)
```

**Implementation Status:**
- Fully Implemented: 100 points
- Partially Implemented: 60 points
- Planned: 30 points
- Not Implemented: 0 points

**Evidence Quality:**
- Automated Evidence: 100 points
- Manual Documentation: 80 points
- Self-Assessment: 60 points
- No Evidence: 0 points

**Testing Results:**
- Passed All Tests: 100 points
- Minor Issues: 80 points
- Major Issues: 40 points
- Failed: 0 points

**Maturity Levels:**
- Optimizing (Level 5): 100 points
- Managed (Level 4): 80 points
- Defined (Level 3): 60 points
- Repeatable (Level 2): 40 points
- Initial (Level 1): 20 points

#### Framework Compliance Calculation

```
Framework Score = Σ(Control Weight × Control Score) / Total Possible Score × 100
```

## AI Provider Management

### Multi-Provider AI Architecture

ARIA5.1 integrates multiple AI providers to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

#### Supported AI Providers

- **Use Cases**: Complex analysis, detailed explanations, creative tasks
- **Configuration**: API key, model selection, temperature settings
- **Cost**: Premium pricing, pay-per-token

**Anthropic Claude:**
- **Strengths**: Safety-focused, analytical, long-context understanding
- **Use Cases**: Risk analysis, compliance guidance, detailed research
- **Configuration**: API key, model version, safety settings
- **Cost**: Competitive pricing, usage-based

**Google Gemini:**
- **Strengths**: Multimodal capabilities, integration with Google services

**Cloudflare Llama3:**
- **Strengths**: Always available, no API key required, cost-effective
- **Use Cases**: Fallback responses, simple queries, high-volume requests
- **Configuration**: Built-in, no setup required
- **Cost**: Included with platform

#### Provider Selection Algorithm

**Intelligent Routing:**
```javascript
function selectProvider(query, context) {
    const complexity = analyzeQueryComplexity(query);
    const availableProviders = getAvailableProviders();
    const userPreferences = getUserPreferences();
    
    if (complexity > 8 && availableProviders.includes('openai')) {
        return 'openai';
    } else if (complexity > 6 && availableProviders.includes('anthropic')) {
        return 'anthropic';
    } else if (availableProviders.includes('google')) {
        return 'google';
    } else if (availableProviders.includes('azure')) {
        return 'azure';
    } else {
        return 'cloudflare'; // Always available fallback
    }
}
```

**Selection Criteria:**
1. **Query Complexity**: Measured on 1-10 scale
2. **Provider Availability**: API status and rate limits
3. **User Preferences**: Configured provider priorities
4. **Cost Considerations**: Budget and usage limits
5. **Performance Requirements**: Response time needs

#### Configuration Management
