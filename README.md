# ARIA5-Ubuntu - Enterprise Security-Hardened AI Risk Intelligence Platform 🔐

## 🚀 **LATEST UPDATE - ENTERPRISE SECURITY HARDENING COMPLETE** 

### 🔒 **SECURITY-HARDENED PLATFORM DEPLOYED** 
**Status**: ✅ **ENTERPRISE-GRADE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

**Critical Security Enhancement Deployed:**
- 🔐 **Enterprise Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- 🔑 **One-Way API Key Management**: Secure server-side storage with masking (per your requirements) 
- 🛡️ **PBKDF2 Password Hashing**: 100,000 iterations using Web Crypto API
- 👥 **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin/User role separation with middleware protection
- 🚫 **CSRF Protection**: Token-based protection for state-changing operations
- ⚡ **Rate Limiting**: Login attempt protection with progressive delays
- 📊 **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All security events tracked in database
- 🔒 **Input Sanitization**: XSS prevention for all user inputs
- 🛡️ **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options protection
- 🔐 **Session Management**: Database-backed sessions with IP tracking

### 🔐 **Enterprise Security Architecture**

**Core Security Libraries Implemented:**
- `src/lib/security.ts` - Enterprise security utilities with PBKDF2, JWT, rate limiting
- `src/lib/api-key-manager.ts` - One-way API key storage system with SHA-256 hashing
- `src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts` - JWT verification, RBAC, CSRF protection
- `src/routes/auth-routes.ts` - Hardened authentication with account lockout
- `src/routes/api-key-routes.ts` - Secure API key CRUD operations

**Security Database Schema:**
- `user_sessions` - Database-backed session management
- `api_keys` - One-way API key storage with hashing
- `security_audit_logs` - Comprehensive security event logging
- Enhanced `users` table with password security fields

### 🔑 **One-Way API Key Management System** (Per Your Requirements)
**Critical Feature**: API keys are stored securely server-side with SHA-256 hashing:
- ✅ **One-Way Operation**: Users can add, update, delete keys but **NEVER view** them after creation
- 🔐 **Masked Display**: Keys show only prefix (e.g., `sk-...7a2f`) for identification
- 🛡️ **Server-Side Only**: Keys never exposed to frontend, stored as hashes
- 📊 **Audit Logging**: All key operations tracked with timestamps and IP addresses
- 🔒 **Secure CRUD**: Create/Read/Update/Delete with proper authentication and validation

**API Key Workflow:**
1. **Add Key**: User inputs key → System hashes it → Displays masked version once → Never shows again
2. **Update Key**: User provides new key → System replaces hash → Shows new masked version
3. **Delete Key**: Removes key from database → Audit logged
4. **View Keys**: Shows list with masked identifiers only (prefix + suffix)

### 🛡️ **Authentication Flow Enhanced**
**Enterprise-grade authentication implemented:**
1. **Login Protection**: Rate limiting with progressive delays (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s)
2. **Account Lockout**: Temporary lockout after 5 failed attempts
3. **JWT Tokens**: HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with expiration
4. **Session Tracking**: Database-backed sessions with IP and user agent
5. **Password Security**: PBKDF2 with 100K iterations and random salt
6. **Audit Logging**: All authentication events logged

### 🔒 **Route Protection Matrix**
**All routes now protected with authentication middleware:**

| Route Category | Protection Level | Requirements |
|---------------|------------------|--------------|
| `/auth/*` | Public | None (login, logout) |
| `/`, `/login`, `/health` | Public | None |
| `/dashboard/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/risk/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/compliance/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/operations/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/intelligence/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/ai/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/admin/*` | Admin Only | Valid JWT token + Admin role |
| `/api/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token |
| `/api/keys/*` | Protected | Valid JWT token (API key management) |

### 📊 **Security Monitoring & Audit**
**Comprehensive security monitoring implemented:**
- **Login Attempts**: Successful and failed login tracking
- **Account Actions**: User creation, updates, role changes
- **API Key Operations**: Key creation, updates, deletions
- **Session Management**: Session creation and expiration tracking
- **IP Tracking**: All actions logged with IP addresses and user agents
