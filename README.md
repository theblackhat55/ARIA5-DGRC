## 🎯 Risk Data Consistency Solution

### 🔍 Root Cause Identified & Fixed ✅
**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The inconsistent risk counts were caused by **duplicate risk tables** in production:
- **Dashboard**: Used `risks` table (5 records) - comprehensive enterprise table
- **Risk Management page**: Used `risks_simple` table (16 records) - legacy/demo table

### 🛠️ Complete Solution Implemented 🔧
1. **RiskDataConsistency Class**: Unified data access layer for all components
2. **Table Standardization**: All components now use comprehensive `risks` table exclusively
3. **Eliminated Fallback Logic**: Removed `risks_simple` fallback that caused confusion
4. **COALESCE Query Strategy**: `COALESCE(risk_score, probability × impact)` ensures schema compatibility
5. **Standardized Risk Levels**: Critical≥20, High 12-19, Medium 6-11, Low<6
6. **Comprehensive API Layer**: 6 new endpoints under `/api/risk-consistency/`

### 📊 Fixed Components
- ✅ `risk-routes-aria5.ts`: Removed `risks_simple` priority, uses comprehensive `risks` table
- ✅ `risk-control-routes.ts`: Switched from `risks_simple` to `risks` table
- ✅ `risk-control-ai-mapper.ts`: Updated to use `risks` table with proper category mapping

### 🎯 Verification: All Components Now Show Identical Data 📊
**Before Fix**: Dashboard (4 total) ≠ Risk Management (14 total) ❌
**After Fix**: All components show consistent data ✅

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "total_risks": 5,
    "active_risks": 5, 
    "critical_risks": 1,
    "high_risks": 3,
    "medium_risks": 1,
    "low_risks": 0
  },
  "metadata": {
    "source": "risk_data_consistency_layer",
    "calculation_method": "COALESCE(risk_score, probability * impact)",
    "thresholds": {
      "critical": "≥ 20",
      "high": "12-19", 
      "medium": "6-11",
      "low": "< 6"
    }
  }
}
```

### 🎉 Impact & Results
