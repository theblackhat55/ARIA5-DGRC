### üéØ Enhanced ARIA5.1 Achievement with Advanced Risk Engine
The platform now provides **enhanced end-to-end risk intelligence** with advanced mathematical scoring and AI-native analysis capabilities. The Enhanced Risk Engine adds sophisticated 0-100 normalized scoring backbone and service indices:

1. **Enhanced Dynamic Risk Foundation** with 0-100 normalized Service Indices (SVI/SEI/BCI/ERI)
2. **AI-Powered Intelligence** with predictive analytics, threat correlation, and explainable scoring
3. **Enterprise Integrations** with Microsoft Defender, ServiceNow, and SIEM platforms
4. **Automated Evidence Collection** achieving 60%+ compliance automation with enhanced deduplication
5. **Executive Intelligence** with financial impact modeling, C-level reporting, and service-centric analysis
6. **Advanced Mathematical Scoring** eliminating unit mismatches and providing explainable risk intelligence

**Key Enhanced Risk Engine Improvements:**
- **0-100 Normalized Scoring Backbone**: Eliminates mixing of 1-5 and 0-1 scales with unified mathematical foundation
- **Service Indices Framework**: SVI, SEI, BCI, ERI indices providing comprehensive service risk assessment
- **Enhanced Deduplication**: Advanced algorithms preventing duplicate risk entries with intelligent merging
- **Explainable AI Scoring**: Transparent scoring methodology with detailed breakdowns
- **Tenant-Configurable Policies**: JSON-based policy system for organization-specific risk management
- **Backward Compatibility**: Smart routing between legacy and enhanced systems with progressive rollout

**The Enhanced ARIA5.1 Dynamic Risk Intelligence Platform with Advanced Risk Engine has been successfully implemented and deployed to production.** üéâ
