## 🎯 Dynamic GRC Vision

### Core Transformation Goals

🎯 **Dynamic Risk Intelligence Platform Features**:

## 🔄 Dynamic Risk Discovery

### Real-Time Risk Generation
- **Defender Integration**: Auto-generate risks from security incidents and vulnerabilities
- **ServiceNow/Jira Integration**: Extract risks from operational tickets and changes
- **Threat Intelligence Risks**: High-confidence IOCs create pending risks for validation
- **Asset Telemetry**: Continuous monitoring creates dynamic risk candidates

### Service-Centric Risk Scoring
- **CIA Triad Scoring**: Services scored on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability impact
- **Risk Cascading**: Asset risks automatically cascade to service-level scoring
- **Real-Time Updates**: Service risk scores reflect operational state within minutes
- **Business Impact View**: Executive dashboards show service-level risk exposure

## 🤖 AI-Enabled Operations

### Intelligent Risk Orchestration
- **Multi-Provider AI**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Azure, Cloudflare Llama3 routing
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML models forecast risk escalation probability
- **Automated Mitigations**: AI suggests mitigations based on similar resolved risks
- **Continuous Learning**: Risk patterns improve prediction accuracy over time

### Threat Intelligence Integration
- **Dynamic IOC Processing**: Real-time threat feed ingestion and correlation
- **Campaign Attribution**: AI-powered threat actor and campaign mapping
- **Risk Generation**: High-confidence threats automatically create pending risks
- **False Positive Learning**: AI learns from rejected threat-generated risks

## ⚖️ Risk-First Compliance

### Compliance as Byproduct
- **Risk → Control Mapping**: Every risk maps directly to relevant compliance controls
- **Automated Evidence**: Technical evidence from Defender, procedural from ITSM
- **Framework Agnostic**: SOC2, ISO27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA support
- **Audit Ready**: One-hour audit package generation vs. days of manual work

### Continuous Compliance Monitoring  
- **Real-Time Status**: Compliance posture reflects current operational state
- **Gap Analysis**: Dynamic identification of control gaps based on risk profile
- **Evidence Trail**: Complete audit trail from risk detection to mitigation
- **Regulatory Intelligence**: Automated monitoring of framework updates and changes
