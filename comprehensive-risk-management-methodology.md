# Comprehensive Risk Management Methodology
## ARIA5.1 Platform - Enhanced Risk Assessment Framework

### üéØ **Overview**
This document describes the comprehensive risk management methodology implemented in ARIA5.1, based on industry best practices and the integrated risk management flow model.

## üìä **Risk Management Flow Model**

### **Core Risk Elements**

#### 1. **THREAT SOURCES** (Origin Layer)
**Definition**: Entities or conditions that can initiate threat events

**Adversarial Threat Sources:**
- **Individuals**: Hackers, malicious insiders, script kiddies
- **Groups**: Organized crime, hacktivist collectives, competitor organizations  
- **Nation States**: Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups, state-sponsored actors

**Non-Adversarial Threat Sources:**
- **Human Error**: Accidental actions by authorized users
- **System Failures**: Hardware malfunctions, software bugs, capacity limits
- **Environmental**: Natural disasters, weather events, physical damage
- **Infrastructure Outages**: Power failures, ISP outages, third-party service disruptions

#### 2. **THREAT EVENTS** (Action Layer)
**Definition**: Specific actions or incidents that can potentially harm the organization

**Relationship**: Threat Sources **impose** Threat Events

**Examples**:
- Hacker (Threat Source) ‚Üí attempts network infiltration (Threat Event)
- Hurricane (Threat Source) ‚Üí causes data center flooding (Threat Event) 
- Employee (Threat Source) ‚Üí accidentally deletes production database (Threat Event)

#### 3. **VULNERABILITIES** (Weakness Layer)
**Definition**: Weaknesses in systems, processes, or controls that can be exploited

**Relationship**: Threat Events **exploit** Vulnerabilities

**Categories**:
- **Technical**: Outdated software, unpatched systems, weak encryption
- **Procedural**: Missing policies, inadequate training, poor change management
- **Physical**: Unsecured facilities, inadequate environmental controls
- **Personnel**: Insufficient background checks, lack of security awareness

#### 4. **ASSETS** (Value Layer)
**Definition**: Resources that have value to the organization

**Asset Hierarchy**:

**Supporting Assets**:
- System components that enable business functions
- Examples: Databases, servers, network equipment, applications
- **Relationship**: Supporting Assets **enable** Primary Assets

**Primary Assets**:
- Critical business processes and information
- What the organization absolutely needs to function
- Examples: Customer data, financial systems, intellectual property

**Asset Impact Flow**: Vulnerabilities ‚Üí **impact** ‚Üí Supporting Assets ‚Üí **enable** ‚Üí Primary Assets

#### 5. **CONTROLS** (Protection Layer)
**Definition**: Safeguards implemented to reduce risk

**Control Types**:

**Preventive Controls**:
- **Purpose**: Deter threats before they occur
- **Action**: **Deter** threat events from exploiting vulnerabilities
- **Examples**: Firewalls, access controls, security training, physical barriers

**Detective Controls**:
- **Purpose**: Identify threats and security events
- **Action**: **Detect** security events and incidents
- **Examples**: IDS/IPS, log monitoring, vulnerability scanning, SIEM systems

**Corrective Controls**:
- **Purpose**: Restore systems after incidents
- **Action**: **Restore** primary assets and reduce impact
- **Examples**: Incident response, backup restoration, disaster recovery

**Control Categories**:
- **Organizational**: Policies, procedures, governance frameworks
- **People**: Training, background checks, role-based access
- **Physical**: Facility security, environmental controls, hardware protection
- **Technological**: Security software, encryption, monitoring systems

#### 6. **SECURITY EVENTS & INCIDENTS** (Impact Layer)

**Security Events**:
- Observable occurrences that may indicate security issues
- **Relationship**: Vulnerabilities **cause** Security Events

**Security Incidents**:
- Confirmed security breaches requiring response
- **Relationship**: Security Events are **classified as** Security Incidents
- **Impact**: Security Incidents **compromise** Operations

## üîÑ **Risk Assessment Process**

### **Step 1: Threat Source Identification**
1. **Catalog Adversarial Threats**:
   - Identify threat actors targeting your industry
   - Assess threat actor capabilities and motivations
   - Evaluate likelihood of targeting your organization

2. **Catalog Non-Adversarial Threats**:
   - Identify environmental risks (natural disasters, infrastructure)
   - Assess human error probabilities
   - Evaluate system failure rates

### **Step 2: Threat Event Mapping**
1. **Link Threats to Events**:
   - Map each threat source to specific threat events
   - Assess frequency and likelihood of each event
   - Consider attack vectors and methods

2. **Prioritize Threat Events**:
   - Rank by likelihood and potential impact
   - Focus on most probable and damaging scenarios

### **Step 3: Vulnerability Assessment**
1. **Technical Vulnerability Scanning**:
   - Automated vulnerability scans
   - Penetration testing
   - Code security reviews

2. **Procedural Vulnerability Assessment**:
   - Policy gap analysis
   - Process maturity evaluation
   - Compliance assessments

3. **Map Exploitability**:
   - Identify which threat events can exploit each vulnerability
   - Assess ease of exploitation
   - Consider vulnerability disclosure and patch availability

### **Step 4: Asset Inventory & Classification**
1. **Asset Discovery**:
   - Comprehensive inventory of all organizational assets
   - Classification as Primary or Supporting assets
   - Document asset dependencies and relationships

2. **Asset Valuation**:
   - Assign criticality levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Assess confidentiality, integrity, and availability requirements
   - Document business impact of asset compromise

### **Step 5: Control Assessment**
1. **Control Inventory**:
   - Catalog existing Preventive, Detective, and Corrective controls
   - Assess control implementation status
   - Evaluate control effectiveness

2. **Control Gap Analysis**:
   - Identify unprotected assets
   - Find vulnerabilities without adequate controls
   - Assess control coverage across threat landscape

### **Step 6: Risk Calculation**
```
Inherent Risk = Threat Likelihood √ó Vulnerability Severity √ó Asset Criticality

Residual Risk = Inherent Risk √∑ Control Effectiveness

Risk Score = Residual Risk (1-25 scale)
```

**Risk Levels**:
- **1-5**: Very Low Risk
- **6-10**: Low Risk  
- **11-15**: Medium Risk
- **16-20**: High Risk
- **21-25**: Very High Risk

### **Step 7: Risk Treatment**
**Risk Treatment Options**:

1. **AVOID**: Eliminate the risk by removing the threat source or vulnerability
2. **MITIGATE**: Reduce risk through additional controls
3. **TRANSFER**: Share risk through insurance or outsourcing
4. **ACCEPT**: Accept remaining risk if within tolerance
