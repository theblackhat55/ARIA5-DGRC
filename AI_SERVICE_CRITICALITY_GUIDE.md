## üöÄ Implementation Guide

### **Step 1: Database Setup**
```bash
# Apply the AI criticality migration
npx wrangler d1 execute aria51-production --local --file=./migrations/0007_ai_service_criticality_simple.sql
```

### **Step 2: Service Integration**
The AI criticality engine is automatically integrated into the Operations module at:
- **URL**: `/operations/services`
- **API Endpoints**: `/operations/api/service-criticality/*`

### **Step 3: Configuration**
Default criticality thresholds:
- **Critical**: 85-100 points
- **High**: 65-84 points  
- **Medium**: 40-64 points
- **Low**: 0-39 points

### **Step 4: Usage**

#### **Automatic Assessment**
```typescript
// Calculate criticality for a specific service
const assessment = await criticalityEngine.calculateServiceCriticality(serviceId);

// Batch process all services
const assessments = await criticalityEngine.batchAssessAllServices();
```

#### **API Endpoints**
```http
POST /operations/api/service-criticality/calculate/:serviceId
GET  /operations/api/service-criticality/assessment/:serviceId  
POST /operations/api/service-criticality/batch-assess
GET  /operations/api/service-criticality/insights/:serviceId
GET  /operations/api/service-criticality/stats
```

#### **Frontend Functions**
```javascript
// Recalculate service criticality
recalculateCriticality(serviceId);

// Show detailed analysis
showCriticalityDetails(serviceId);

// Refresh all services
refreshServices();

// Trigger batch AI assessment
triggerBatchAssessment();
```

## üß† AI/ML Methodology

### **Feature Engineering**
The system extracts and processes the following features:

1. **CIA Metrics**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability scores (0-5 scale)
2. **Dependency Metrics**: Asset count, critical asset count, dependency strength
3. **Risk Metrics**: Associated risk count, high-severity risk count, aggregated risk score
4. **Business Metrics**: Function criticality, user impact scope, revenue impact
5. **Technical Metrics**: RTO/RPO hours, SLA percentage requirements
6. **Historical Metrics**: Incident frequency, downtime patterns, security events

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```python
# Weighted criticality calculation
final_score = (
    cia_weighted_score * 0.40 +
    asset_dependency_impact * 0.25 +
    risk_correlation_impact * 0.20 +
    business_impact_score * 0.10 +
    technical_requirements_score * 0.03 +
    historical_pattern_score * 0.02
